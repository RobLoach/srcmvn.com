I have been following the [Symfony2](http://symfony.com/) camp
for almost a year now. I finally had the opportunity to start
a new project with the full-stack framework.

Most things looked good on paper but the cost of trying
something new had been too high to justify making the leap
for any projects that have come up over the last year. That
changed earlier this month.

So far I am quite pleased. The integration with
[Doctrine ORM](http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm) is
great and the Symfony2
[Service Container](http://symfony.com/doc/2.0/book/service_container.html)
has been surprisingly pleasant to work with.

If I have any complaints it would be what I knew would be
issues for me going in; bundles. The heavy focus on reuse by
way of standardization *to the namespace level* was something
I disliked from my first glance at Symfony2.

I hope to get a much better understanding of bundles and their
intricacies sooner rather than later. Ideally I would like to be
able to get my code placed wherever I want and just use bundles
to integrate between domain logic and the Symfony2 integration.
For now I have just been doing everything in a bundle.

In addition to the code itself, the extended Symfony2 community
is pretty impressive. Some very cool people and some
[very](http://packagist.org) [cool](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/)
[projects](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/). I am super excited to
be able to try and get involved in some of these projects.
