For as connected as everything is, everything feels very disconnected. I've
found that to be even more true now that I've converted to a statically
generated blog.

My feed works as it ever did, but truly integrating into any other popular
system is going to require a lot of work as few of them support Atom or RSS
directly (I say this generously, I'm not sure any of them actually do). Most
third party solutions I have looked at are either unreliable or do the bare
minimum and lack customization.

This could of course be handled by [Sculpin](http://getsculpin.com) itself,
but that system (and others like it) are designed to push data out to disk
and then be published with no real state stored at any step of the way. Did
I push to Twitter yet? Did I send trackbacks? At least pubsubhubbub is more
or less idempotent, though it would require someone already be subscribed
to be of any use. I'd love to find a universal solution to this problem.

I dig [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/). I'm not sure at what point I
started following his blog but sometime last year I realized I was
starting to get a lot out of his feed. Reading his content has been a
huge inspiration to start producing my own. Now if only there was a way to
connect this post to his so that he'd know I had joined the conversation.
