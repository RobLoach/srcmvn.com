title: Spinto — A Web Interfaces for VCS Backed Websites

---

Not long ago [I asked a question](http://srcmvn.com/blog/2012/02/21/static-site-generator-admin-interface/) about whether or not it made sense
for a VCS backed static site to have a lite web admin interface.
It seems as though someone has already worked on this —
[Spinto](http://www.spintoapp.com) is a WYSIWYG web interface for
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) backed websites.

I haven't checked out [Spinto](http://www.spintoapp.com) yet but
I plan to. Curious to see how it looks and feels.

More and more I think that something like this should be available
to augment the individual file based workflow of most file based
static site generators I've looked into.
